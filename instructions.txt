1. Duplicate the folder bubbleofglass and change to the name of the new work.

2. Open the new folder, go to assets folder and replace the images with new ones. 
Name the files in a similar way to the previous ones.

3. Open index.html in the new folder. Check for green comments in the file. 
Comments describe where to put the new information.

4. Next go to the folder work, open work.html and add the new "work" link.
